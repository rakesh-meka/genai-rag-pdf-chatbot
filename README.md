# 📚 AskYourPDF – Conversational PDF Assistant with RAG

Turn static PDF documents into an interactive AI-powered knowledge assistant.

AskYourPDF is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that enables users to upload PDF files and interact with their content through natural language conversations. Instead of manually searching through lengthy documents users can ask questions and receive context-aware responses grounded in the uploaded document.

Built using Streamlit, LangChain, FAISS, Hugging Face Embeddings, and Groq-powered Llama models, this project demonstrates a complete end-to-end RAG workflow.

## 💡 Example

**User:**

> What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?

**Assistant:**

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with language generation. Relevant document chunks are retrieved first and then provided to the language model to generate accurate, context-aware answers grounded in the source content.
